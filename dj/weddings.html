<strong>NHANCED RECEPTION:</strong><a id="nhancedweddingreception" name="nhancedweddingreception"></a>

Our Nhanced Wedding Reception is recommended when your celebration needs your DJ service to play an active role in its coordination and choreography.

The absolute best way to assure your Reception receives a more interactive service is to provide two entertainers for your event, a Disc Jockey/Music Programmer and a Master of Ceremonies/MC Host. While the Disc Jockey focuses on the music, requests and program changes, the Master of Ceremonies has his attention on the details and flow of your Reception. The entire event will be coordinated by the Master of Ceremonies from the initial introductions to the final goodbye. Your Reception will run smoothly since your MC works closely with you, your bridal party, Catering Manager, and Photographer. The Master of Ceremonies will also interact with your guests, motivating them onto the dance floor to partake in all the fun.

As in our <em>Beyond Wedding Reception</em> package, our State-of-the-Art Sound system and special lighting deliver high quality sound and the perfect ambiance to the reception.
Package Includes:
<ul>
	<li>Disc Jockey</li>
	<li>Master of Ceremonies</li>
	<li>Complete Coordination of Details</li>
	<li>5 Hours of service</li>
	<li>State-of-the-Art Sound System</li>
	<li>LED Lighting System with Multi-Color Dance Lighting</li>
	<li>Wireless and wired microphones</li>
</ul>
